# **Simple Shell Project**

**Description:**
a UNIX command line interpreter.

The Shell should:

- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command.
- A command line always ends with a new line.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
- Handle errors.
- Handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
- Handle command lines with arguments.
- Handle the PATH
- Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell.
- Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment.
- Implement the builtin command ( cd ).
